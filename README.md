City Sitter was designed for parents who need a night out. The idea is for parents to post jobs and for potentinal sitters to apply to them. Their is a log in page that prevents you from going to the dashboard page where you can post and view jobs without first signing in or signing up. 

Technologies used: 
  Sequelize to store user information and the job listings. 
  Handlebars/HTML/CSS/Bootstraps for the design. 
  We utliized passport to set up the log in page and used a hash key to create the password. Using a hash key prevents a person from being   able to see passwords in the database.
